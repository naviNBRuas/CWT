# CWT - Crypto & NFT Withdrawal Tool (Ambitious Vision)

## Project Overview

The Crypto & NFT Withdrawal Tool (CWT) is envisioned as a groundbreaking, universally compatible, and highly intelligent system designed to autonomously consolidate digital assets (cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens) from an extensive array of sources to a single, user-defined main withdrawal address. Our ambition is to create a truly 'set-and-forget' solution that operates seamlessly across any device, platform, and architecture, leveraging advanced automation techniques to interact with virtually any digital asset repository.

CWT aims to be the ultimate digital asset aggregator, capable of navigating the complexities of various blockchain ecosystems, exchange interfaces, and wallet technologies. From browser-based extensions to cold storage files, CWT seeks to provide a unified mechanism for asset recovery and consolidation, ensuring that your digital wealth is always within reach and under your control.

## Core Features

-   **Universal Asset Consolidation:** Automatically identify, collect, and withdraw both cryptocurrencies and NFTs from a vast array of sources.
-   **Multi-Source Support:** Seamlessly integrate with:
    -   **Major Crypto Exchanges:** Automated login and withdrawal processes for leading centralized exchanges.
    -   **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) & DeFi Protocols:** Intelligent interaction with smart contracts and liquidity pools.
    -   **Browser-Based Wallets:** Direct interaction with popular browser extensions like MetaMask, Phantom, Keplr, etc., utilizing existing browser sessions and stored credentials (cookies, default logins).
    -   **Software Wallets:** Integration with desktop and mobile software wallets via their respective APIs or automation interfaces.
    -   **Cold File Wallets:** Advanced (and carefully secured) mechanisms to interact with encrypted cold storage files, potentially requiring secure offline signing prompts.
    -   **Faucets & Airdrops:** Automated collection from various distribution mechanisms.
-   **Intelligent Withdrawal Routing:** Dynamic analysis of network fees, withdrawal limits, and asset availability to determine the most efficient and cost-effective withdrawal paths.
-   **Automatic Fallback & Retry Mechanisms:** Robust error handling with intelligent retries and fallback to alternative withdrawal methods or sources in case of failures.
-   **NFT Collection & Management:** Specialized modules for identifying, valuing, and transferring NFTs from marketplaces and personal wallets.
-   **Secure Credential Management:** Prioritizing security through environment variables (`.env`), encrypted configuration files, and integration with secure credential stores.
-   **Auditable Operations:** Comprehensive logging and reporting of all transactions, withdrawals, and system activities for transparency and accountability.
-   **CLI-Driven & API-Ready:** A powerful command-line interface for direct control, with an underlying architecture designed for future API integration.
-   **Multi-Platform & Multi-Architecture Compatibility:** Engineered to run natively or via containerization (e.g., Docker) on Windows, macOS, Linux, ARM-based devices, and more.

## Universal Compatibility: Run Anywhere, Collect Everything

CWT's design philosophy centers on maximum portability and adaptability. By leveraging Python and containerization technologies like Docker, CWT aims to operate consistently across:

-   **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux (various distributions).
-   **Hardware Architectures:** x86, ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi, mobile devices).
-   **Deployment Environments:** Local machines, cloud servers, virtual private servers (VPS), embedded systems.

This universal approach ensures that users can deploy CWT wherever it's most convenient and efficient for their asset consolidation needs.

## Advanced Login & Wallet Integration

CWT's ability to access and withdraw from a diverse range of digital asset sources is a cornerstone of its ambitious vision:

-   **Browser-Based Wallets:** CWT will intelligently interact with browser extensions. This involves:
    -   **Cookie Utilization:** Leveraging existing browser cookies to maintain logged-in sessions.
    -   **Default Browser Logins:** Utilizing saved passwords and auto-fill features where possible and secure.
    -   **Extension Control:** Employing advanced browser automation techniques to directly interact with wallet extensions (e.g., confirming transactions, switching networks).
-   **Software Wallets:** Integration will be achieved through:
    -   **Official APIs:** Where available, CWT will use official SDKs or APIs provided by wallet developers.
    -   **Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs):** Automating interactions with CLI-based wallet tools.
    -   **Direct Automation:** For wallets without APIs, CWT will employ UI automation techniques (e.g., image recognition, virtual keyboard inputs) in a highly controlled and secure environment.
-   **Cold File Wallets:** This is the most sensitive area. CWT will *never* directly access private keys or seed phrases from cold storage without explicit, secure, and auditable user consent. Interaction will be limited to:
    -   **Secure Prompting:** Guiding the user through an offline signing process.
    -   **Hardware Wallet Integration:** Future support for popular hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) via their respective APIs, requiring physical user confirmation.

## Security & Auditing

Given the sensitive nature of handling digital assets, CWT prioritizes security and transparency:

-   **Zero-Knowledge Principle:** CWT aims to minimize its knowledge of sensitive user credentials, relying on secure environment variables and encrypted configurations.
-   **Auditable Logs:** Every action, transaction attempt, and system event is meticulously logged, providing a clear audit trail for users.
-   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Built-in mechanisms to prevent account lockouts or suspicious activity flags on exchanges.
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Handling:** Strategies for handling 2FA prompts, potentially involving user interaction or secure integration with MFA providers.

## Getting Started

To get started with CWT, you'll need Python 3.8+ and Docker installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CWT.git
    cd CWT
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root with your main withdrawal address:
    ```
    CWT_MAIN_WITHDRAWAL_ADDRESS="your_main_crypto_address_here"
    ```
    For exchange credentials, it is highly recommended to use environment variables as well (e.g., `EXCHANGE_A_USERNAME`, `EXCHANGE_A_PASSWORD`).

3.  **Configure `config.ini`:**
    Edit `CWT_CLI/config.ini` to specify the exchanges you want to automate, their types, and any non-sensitive configuration details. Example:
    ```ini
    [DEFAULT]
    # main_withdrawal_address will be read from .env first, then this config

    [EXCHANGE_A]
    type = ExampleAutomator # Or BinanceAutomator, CoinbaseAutomator, etc.
    base_url = https://example.com
    # username and password should ideally come from environment variables
    currency = BTC
    amount = 0.001

    [EXCHANGE_B]
    type = ExampleAutomator
    # ... other configurations
    ```

4.  **Build and Run with Docker (Recommended for Universal Compatibility):**
    ```bash
    docker build -t cwt-tool .
    docker run --rm -it --env-file ./.env cwt-tool
    ```
    *Note: For browser automation, Docker might require additional setup for GUI access or running in headless mode.* 

5.  **Run Natively (Requires browser installation):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python CWT_CLI/main.py
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you have a compatible browser (e.g., Chrome) and its corresponding WebDriver installed and accessible in your PATH for `undetected-chromedriver`.*

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

This project is highly ambitious, and the current implementation serves as a foundational step. Future development will focus on:

-   **Implementing Specific Exchange Automators:** Developing robust automators for a wide range of centralized and decentralized exchanges.
-   **Browser Extension Integration:** Advanced techniques for interacting with MetaMask, Phantom, and other browser wallets.
-   **NFT Protocol Support:** Modules for ERC-721, ERC-1155, and other NFT standards across various blockchains.
-   **Hardware Wallet API Integration:** Securely interfacing with Ledger, Trezor, etc.
-   **Advanced Fallback Strategies:** Implementing more sophisticated logic for asset routing and recovery.
-   **User Interface Development:** Potentially a web-based dashboard for easier management and monitoring.
-   **Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Rigorous testing to ensure the integrity and security of the system.
